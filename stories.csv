When our plane landed and I disembarked, the Miami International Airport looked *so* strange, and the people that stopped in their tracks to stare at us in utter shock were confusing me.

The clothes people were wearing looked odd, and the women did not wear hats, gloves...and what a disgrace, the women were not wearing dresses but embarrassing themselves and parading around in pants like *men*??

I was hungry, *so, so hungry*, and though my husband said he would be waiting, I didn't see him, so I walked to the nearest food stand, a new place I had never seen called ""Cinnabon"", ignoring that the woman in front of me looked back at me, then ran out of line, dragging her young son with her.

I got in line, hearing screams in the airport, and as I looked over at a newsstand, I saw with unbelieving eyes the date on a magazine was June 1, 2021--our plane was Airliner NC16002, leaving Puerto Rico heading to Miami on December 28, 1948, a direct flight over the Bermuda Triangle--what *sick* joke was this, then I glanced at my reflection in a mirror and understood."
1,"Millionaire.

When my checking account registered $1,500,853 on Tuesday afternoon when I checked it before leaving for lunch, I thought it was a glitch with my app, so I refreshed it, but it still read the same balance.

I only had $853 in the account just this morning, and my account history didn't show any transfer or deposit of $1,500,000, which made it more strange--no record of it arriving in my account.

I called the bank and they confirmed the same balance I saw on my app, and after I hung up, I sat dumbfounded in my office chair, a mixture of growing happiness and worry, trying to figure how what the heck was going on.

A text message suddenly appeared under PRIVATE NUMBER: ""The police will be told that you hacked $1,500,000 from the Community Bank of Lillville if you don't meet me in 10 minutes in your office building lobby, complete the task I will give you (I will be wearing a red hat) and destroy this phone when you are done reading this...we are watching."""
2,"LIVE ON THE SCENE!

""Thats right, Kelly, if you look just over my shoulder there you can see the sinkhole itself stretching nearly four city blocks!

In fact, if you follow me a moment, you can see climbers behind the barrier preparing to rapel into the - oh, here they go!

Now, the tremors have been one thing, Kelly, but not a single body has been recovered yet, even from the more accessible sections of t- oh it looks like the climbers are already returning!

Hold on, there seems to be some commotion - yes it seems the rescuers have recovered several bodies... No, no... That's one body... Cut it, cut the feed, cut the feed now!"""
3,"The New Kid

There was something off about the new kid in our high school--and not counting the annoying black goth clothing, the piercings and spike jewelry--there was definitely something weird about the way he looked at everyone.

Sitting at the desk behind Goth Boy during math class, I wondered whether he had any brothers or sisters who also dressed--he turned around suddenly and said quietly, ""No, I'm an only child.""

He turned back around to listen to the teacher, and I froze, my eyes wide with shock and I wondered if I had accidently said what I was thinking out loud.

He turned back *again* and whispered, ""No, you didn't accidently say out loud if you wondered if I had brothers or sisters, I can read minds--and the whole Goth Boy thing you call me in your head is super annoying, so please just use my name, it's Matt, and it's nice to meet you."""
4,"Seven

Seven. 

How can such a boring number be so frightening? 

*Seven*. 

Seven months to go."
5,"Rot

I’ve been dead for a long time now. 

I have been diagnosed with a multitude of illnesses and stuffed full of pills, but no one will listen when I tell them why they don’t work.

I am rotting from the inside out, there are black worms squirming under my skin and my bone marrow has turned to dust.  

I can barely move, or think, or speak, and I can’t wait until I lose these abilities entirely."
6,"Click.

The constant *click, click, click* of the calculator keys as I do math grates my nerves, reminds me of the incessant, irritating, tapping of a woodpecker on a tree.

Being the senior Certified Public Accountant assigned to many huge finance contracts requires putting in long hours on that damn calculator.

Fortunately for me, I quit my job yesterday.

Today, the constant *click, click, click* of the calculator keys as I add the millions of dollars I've stolen from those huge finance contracts over 22 years is the sweetest sound in the world."
7,"Extinction.

I pushed the pod doors open, leaving my partner and raced upstairs to unlock the sewer drain cover, and to my joy, I didn't see a wasteland, but a city bustling with life--did we *finally* change our fate and save our future?

Looking frantically around for signs of the creatures, I ran up to the first person I saw with a phone and asked, ""Can I please borrow your phone--I have to see if we caused them to go extinct, because if  not, we're as good as dead,"" my voice trembling.

With an amused look, the guy handed me his phone and I searched *'are dinosaurs extinct'* and read the first result with relief, ""The last dinosaurs died approximately 65 million years ago, dying out soon after a huge meteorite crashed to Earth near the Gulf of Mexico.""

The time travel mission worked after ***so*** many attempts, I thought, crying with happiness--what history recorded as ""meteorites"" were actually atomic bombs we used to wipe out the wretched lizards in order to save humanity from the many centuries of reptilian war that had plagued us."
8,"Coco.

The cat I brought home from the Ralcon Veterinary Hospital after a three day stay is not my cat.

He looks like Coco but doesn't act like him--he doesn't meow, doesn't let me pet him, doesn't rub against my legs, or lay next to my pillow at night like Coco used to.

This new Coco doesn't eat or drink, it only follows me from room to room, sitting one foot away only to stare at me, its green eyes never blinking or wavering eye contact.

It's now been two weeks of this odd behavior, and realizing my old Coco will never return, I decided this new Coco was too scary to keep, so I got the cat carrier and as I went to grab it to put it inside, ""Coco"" backed up quickly, defiantly sat back down, looked me in the eyes and said in an deep, otherworldly voice ""I am not going anywhere."""
9,"The ocean.



She finally got to the water's edge, placing her left foot into the cold ocean water, then slowly putting her right foot in, watching the wet sand softly wrap itself around her feet, welcoming her.

The beachgoers were long gone, and the moonlight was reflecting off the water only for small fragments of time as the clouds playing a heavenly tug-of-war as to who had the right to be seen in the night sky.

She walked deeper, deeper, toward the depths ahead, and as the water lapped around her neck, she involuntary shivered from the frigid temperatures, panic rising from deep inside, making her jump back, again and back even more, her arms flailing, until the water was only at her knees.

Crying, she turned and walked back to the shore, she couldn't do it, but what was the other option, just living with the pain?"
10,"?

He preferred the quiet and calm of night, she loved the brightness and buzz of people during the day.

She loved big family gatherings and trying new foods, while he would rather stay home every weekend and eat nothing but spaghetti or hot dogs.

She sat there for what felt like hours, looking back and forth from the engagement ring to his handsome, worried brown eyes.

He had alerted everyone in the restaurant and they cheered when he popped the question, but it was becoming uncomfortably clear to all involved that her answer was going to be no."
11,"The Breville.

The big stuff has all been divided at the divorce settlement--the furniture, art, camping equipment, books and various other ""sundries"".

Passing through the kitchen to grab an empty moving box from the den, I stopped suddenly, glancing at the $900 Breville Barista Pro espresso maker and realizing we forgot to decide who takes it.

Listening to make sure he wasn't coming downstairs, I quickly grabbed a trash bag, stuffed the espresso maker in it and ran it to my SUV and buried it under an old Green Bay Packers picnic blanket in the back.

I hated espresso drinks--but damn if I was going to let him and his *new* woman enjoy them."
12,"The Professor



I just killed my professor.

We were alone in the classroom, I needed help with homework, but he was **too** close, he kept touching my back and arms.

I was uncomfortable, I kept moving away, but he kept getting closer, and when his hand touched my butt I screamed for him to stop and pushed him hard, *too* hard.

He lost his balance and hit his head on the corner of his desk and he's on the floor not moving--what the hell do I do now?"
13,"Catch and Release.

Fishing here alone always brought me peace, I found people were a nuisance, they lied, were rude, ungrateful and selfish.

Other men liked to hunt, but I could never bear the thought of killing anything, even fish--I always released them once they got on my hook.

Killing was an awful thing, which is why my girlfriend's ex-boyfriend was still alive.

He was safely tied up in my shed at home, and even though he had asked her to get back together with him, I won't kill him, he will just stay in there unharmed until he changes his mind."
14,"The Talk.

""So, basically, that's how your body changes in your teens and how reproduction works, you know in a basic way,"" my Dad said awkwardly, ""And remember, you can always talk to me about anything--do you have any questions?""

""Oh, no, no, I understand everything, we are definitely done with this discussion,"" I said, jumping up from my bed, ""I'm still not sure why you needed to draw diagrams of everything,"" I said, waving my hand over the sea of horrifically drawn images of male and female body parts, some of them engaged in well, let's just say forms of ""reproduction.""

""Omer, I don't want you looking at porn to see the images we talked about, the internet can guide in you in directions that aren't good,"" he said and starting to gather them up, ""Oh wait, not unless, do you want to keep these?""

""Oh no, Dad, please take them away,"" I said, quickly helping him pick up the pictures and trying not to laugh, knowing that even though it was one of the most awkward hours I had spent with him, I was reminded of the great relationship we had, and it was an experience I would probably have with my own son one day--minus the pictures."
15,"Just. Don't. Fall.

The 'Challenge Club' started a *Just.Don't.Fall.* challenge:  once you reach the middle of the Industry River bridge, go to the security railing, jump to the other side and lean forward with your hands gripping the railing behind you.

This was my first challenge and I loved it, and looking down at the swiftly moving river below, I felt exhilarated, strong winds whipping my hair and my hands trying to keep a grip on the slick bridge railing.

One club member always attended the challenges to take pictures to prove you are performing it, and Frank was the member with me today.

Frank stopped taking pictures, ""You're doing good, but I'm afraid we're not accepting new members at this time,"" he said, suddenly pushing my hands off the bridge rail, my screams echoing as I plummeted toward the raging river."
16,"Lost.

Has it been 7 days since I've been out here?

I felt dizzy, hot, hungry, *so thirsty*, but I kept pushing on, stumbling ungracefully over unending rocks, twigs and dry grass looking for a sign to help me get out of these woods and back to civilization.

I wanted water, I wanted it so bad, but knowing there was none, I flopped down on the ground and pulled my backpack off my back, reaching for my thermos.

Opening it, I drank large gulps of the only liquid that was keeping me alive, and as I recapped the thermos, I waited several minutes for the taste of my urine to subside before getting up and moving on."
17,"Presentation Day

*I'm in love with my boss, I'm in* ***freaking*** *love with him which is the stupidest, STUPIDEST, thing I could let happen,* I thought, angrily clutching my presentation folder and marching to the conference room.

I get there and glance around the packed table, my anger turning to disappointment when I see that my boss isn't there, and offering a weak smile and nod to everyone, I walk to the podium, pick up the projector remote and open my folder.

Nervously looking at my notes, I feel someone squeeze my arm, I glance up and my stomach flips and my breathing stops, ""I know you're going to do a terrific job today,"" my boss whispered, smiling as he walked to an empty seat.

My legs go weak and my arm tingles from his touch, but my confidence soars through the roof, ""Good morning everyone,"" I broadcast loudly with the biggest smile, ""let's get started."""
18,"The morgue

I've seen many mangled bodies during my time at the morgue.

They didn't scare me anymore after the eleventh one, but this one was different.

This one was wearing my face.

And than i heared a voice behind me ""hello"""
19,"The Office

I hate my co-workers.

I can hear them at times in the common area or in the copy room making fun of the way I talk, how I dress, even how I walk.

Sadly, I can't punish them all, but whoever keeps taking my lunch out of the refrigerator and eating it was in for a surprise today.

The spread on my lunch croissant was filled of 60% Nutella and 40% ground up chocolate laxative."
20,"Midnight.

It was midnight, the time they asked me to take Nelson for a walk, and as the moon lit our trail, I pulled my jacket tight and enjoyed the sound of fallen leaves crunching under my sneakers.

From my peripheral vision, I could see the familiar orange light appear, getting brighter from behind us, its intensity and deafening hum coming from the transporter making Nelson turn around and bark.

I felt the sudden rush of air and heat on my back and closed my eyes, calm this time, knowing that the extraterrestrials were not going to hurt us.

Inside my head, I heard the collection of 10,000 otherworldly voices united as one, *""Welcome back, come with us.""*"
21,"Logging in

This morning I woke up in Tokyo in 2050, just another one of those neurological advertisements I get every day through my implants ever since I cancelled my Life Gold+ subscription. 

Most of these ads are pretty annoying, but this toothpaste ad is my favorite, so eerily calm and pleasant and smells like menthol. 

I was so excited when at an outback tech forum I found this hacking script which prevents ads from ever ending, allowing you to lock yourself in forever. 

Reality you ugly bitch time to never see you again, I think to myself and execute exodus.exe on my implant, fingers crossed it doesn't kill me on the spot."
22,"A new end

The coffee tasted terrible.

Maybe it was the blend, the grind, the cheap machine, or maybe it was the diluted blood that had already coagulated against the side of the paper cup.

Louis glared glumly at at the swirling red-brown conction until an elbow dug into his side and he found himself on his feet, saying ""Hello, my name is Louis, and I am a vampire, and i am just looking for my new beginning - or end maybe.""

""Welcome, Louis,"" the others said in bored synchronicity, their voices echoing through the empty church hall."
23,"Running west

I was at the back of the RV, trying to sleep on the bed, as it was Eric's turn on the wheel. 

We are heading west because we figured the only way to avoid the vampire horde is to never let the Sun go down. 

It's really hard to sleep with the Sun constantly up, and we don't even have a decent curtain on the back windows of the RV. 

I have no idea what's next when we reach the western coastline, if we don't find a boat, we're as good as dead."
24,"Open Road

The longer I drove, the more the pain seemed to rise in my heart, this pain wasn't disappearing behind me like the mile markers on the highway were.

I glance at the clock and saw that three hours had passed, driving nowhere, driving somewhere, driving now to look for a gas station and a decent hotel to stay for a few nights.

Putting down my dog Blaine this morning due to his illness was one of the hardest things I ever had to do, and after eight years of being together, he was my closest family and best friend all wrapped into one.

I needed a few nights away from work, my boyfriend, life in general, I needed time to sort my emotions before heading back to the home Blaine and I shared--things would get better in time, I was sure of it, but for now, I needed this."
25,"Breathe Deep

""Lastly recruits, you have an emergency flare so that, in the case of an unfortunate alternation with the flora, your body and the precious gasses you worked so hard to collect can be recovered!""

Bris braced herself as the video ended with a jaunty jingle and the hatch opened, causing her visor to quickly darkened against a more brilliant sun here on Earth.

""Listen up, kids,"" her instructor said, her voice coming in loud and gravelly over the headset, ""some of you may be Pneums yourself - that does not give you the right to breathe the product!""

Bris closed her eyes, ignoring the blaring voice in her ear, simply waiting to fill her lungs with fresh oxygen for the first time in her life - and hopefully sample some of the supernatural powers only the rich could afford to breathe."
26,"Sand.

I don't like sand.

It's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.

Not like you.

You're everything smooth and soft."
27,"The Bermuda Journal, Final Entry

The haunting, lilting, flitting flirty music drifts softly, yet swiftly like my silken linen sails sent a drift in the non-existent breeze!

It pops and dribbles in my ears like whales or eggs and ebbs and flows in sympathy, my vessel's symphony rocking silently just for me.

I laugh and cry and beg and fry and sing with wordless melody to a horizon stretching on from me - yes, i sing along to a choir yet unseen.

Its been days, no weeks, yet maybe years since last I'd been seen, here alone with my ghostly orchestra, Poseidon's master symphonic serenade of the sea."
28,"I'm fine

Eric gave me a concerned look, his eyebrows furrowed; ""Are you sure you're okay?"" he said, frowning. 

I glanced slightly to the left, staring at the man who had been my captor for so long; his face was twisted in a sly grin. 

With a small smile, I turned back to Eric, speaking softly, ""I'm fine,"" so he reluctantly got up, patting me on the shoulder, and left. 

Turning back to where the man had stood, I found he was no longer there, as I expected; he was dead, and I had seen his body... *I'm fine.*"
29,"Loyalty.

The Gambian Pouched rats became an invasive species in the Florida Keys after a breeder allowed them to escape in the early 2000's.

Since then, the rats have become not only large in number, but large in size--many at least 20 pounds--a fact I know well since I go into the sewers regularly to feed and visit my nearly 3,000 rodent friends.

I went inside the sewer opening located a half mile from my house, crying uncontrollably as I thought about the news reports alerting of a large extermination that was about to begin, they were going to  kill every sewer rat due to a massive outbreak of rabies that made them leave the sewers and attack people.

I look off my clothes, laid on the cold sewer floor and welcomed the bites of the hundreds of foaming mouths of rats as they tore into my flesh--these creatures were my friends, my family, and I didn't want to be in a world were I would have to be without them."
30,"News.

It was another hot Arizona day, and when getting the mail I saw that I had received a letter from my best friend who died 1 year ago with no return address, just her name.

Staring at her name, I barely remember walking back to the house and locking the door.

With trembling hands, I opened the letter and read it, confusion settling over me as I learned that my friend was actually *not* dead, but had to pretend she was in order to start a new life in Canada with her new baby.

Apparently, my husband of 10 years who I had just kissed goodbye as he headed to work, has a 1 year old child, the mother of this child being my best friend and he has no clue she had gotten pregnant."
31,"The Forest.

After work, I ate dinner, tied my hair up into a ponytail, then went outside and entered the forest across the street from my house.

This forest was my sanctuary, I welcomed the burst of honeysuckle scented air, loved to see the blinding summer sun get pushed back to a dim glimmer behind the dense treetops and embraced the hum of life—birds, insects and frogs—each offering their own unique vocals to produce the world’s most beautiful chorus.

I didn’t notice the body until I was a few feet from it—I had been blissfully looking up, enjoying the different leaf shapes, so I screamed seeing a bloody mound of what was once human, now chewed up pulps of flesh, innards, exposed bones, and as I backed away I noticed that the only recognizable thing left were a pair of pink flipflops hanging limply at the end of bruised ankles...did an animal do this...what, who, *did* this?

As I ran back to the house, I threw open the door and raced to my cell phone to call the police, realizing through tears and shaking hands that not only did someone lose their life, but what was once my unblemished getaway was now tainted and no longer safe ever again."
32,"The Cardinal.

The day I walked out of the hospital, I saw the brightest red cardinal perched on the metal fence that bordered the hospital grounds.

It was cute at first, but then I thought it strange how his black, beady eyes followed me as I slowly walked down the sidewalk to the street, his jerky head seemed to ponder whether or not I should be leaving after having such an extensive heart valve operation.

As I got into the Uber and started the journey back to my lonely apartment, I found it unsettling how he intently watched as we drove away.

Two days later, as I leaned against the kitchen sink waiting for the ambulance to come after the agonizing chest pains started again, I saw a cardinal in the bush outside of my kitchen window and I swear he winked at me."
33,"The Library.

The library closed at 4pm to the public, and after Linda shut down her PC at 5pm, she gathered her purse and walked to the NEW RELEASES table, picking up ‘The Night Will End’ by Sean O'Nelle and walked to the back where there were no security cameras.

Very gently, she completely tore out pages 194 and 202 from the book, knowing that this was when major plot turns happened, balled them up and stashed the crumpled pages in her front pants pocket.

Putting the book back on the table, she smiled as she thought of how annoyed the next reader would be at missing such important pages, and thought about what the next book would be that she would “enhance” tomorrow.

She had hated her job for years, but not until recently did she realize just how much fun being a librarian could be."
34,"Adoption Day

A small brown dog was shivering behind the glass paneling. 

A small boy came to the shelter and picked her out.  

She started wagging her tail and the the tension left her body.  

Hazel was home."
35,"The ride

Riding on the highway on my motorcycle.

I look back and take in your smile.

The blank eyes and furry ears on the plush that sits there now remind me of those years, nevermore to return.

Where you once sat, there is now just a bear memory."
36,"Restock.

The windshield wipers squeaking and fighting the hard rain was the only sound inside the car's dark interior as I waited alone behind the wheel in the night.

I felt the engine shudder as I nervously peered through the passenger side window at the rundown house my partner Dean went into to turn in our profit for a new supply of meth, weed and cocaine.

Dean was taking *way* too long, maybe those thugs figured out we stole some of the money and didn't believe our lie about waiting for some customers to pay up.

Just as I was about to text Dean, I saw him throw open the front door, running at top speed toward our car just as a series of gunshots blazed bright orange and yellow behind him, dropping him to the ground in a motionless heap."
37,"Baby Monitor.

A loud scream followed by crying erupted from the baby monitor at 1:00am and startled me awake, but I closed my eyes again when it went silent, half listening in my dark bedroom for the escalating cries that normally follow.

To my surprise, my 4 month old stayed quiet, she was getting better at sleeping longer between feedings and I blissfully fell back into a deep, dreamless sleep.

When I finally woke, I smiled feeling rested and rolled over and looked at the clock, it was 11am--I sat up with a jolt, Amanda has **never** slept this long, was she *okay*?

I raced down the hall to the baby's room and I screamed when I saw that Amanda was not in her crib, there was only a piece of paper with words written from a black magic marker, ""If you want to see your baby again, answer your cell phone at noon for instructions on where to send us $100,000."""
38,"Fiji.

As the 15 of us sat down for dinner in celebration of my brother’s college graduation, I made sure to avoid eye contact with my step-father Mike.

This morning I had started down the basement stairs to go to the dryer, but heard my step-father already down there, talking on his cell and making arrangements to move 500 pounds of meth to a  guy in Suva, Fiji.

Shock froze me on the steps, then I heard him hang up, listened to footsteps and found him suddenly at the bottom of the basement stairs, our eyes locking for a beat before he roughly pushed past me on the stairwell, my feet planted like cement.

Now at the dinner table, while my Mom told everyone how disappointed she was that Mike wasn't letting her go to Fiji with him for his business convention, I took a chance and glanced at Mike and found him glaring at me."
39,"The Inheritance.

Rob felt that faking his marriage to Kelly was getting harder, but he had to marry someone and stay married for two years in order for them both to get the $800,000 inheritance from his Uncle Jack.

Rob didn't *hate* Kelly, but he recently found out about one exception to the rule that would allow the money to be released immediately--if either Rob or Kelly died, the surviving spouse gets all of the money on the day of the funeral.

As Kelly drank the wine he poured for her in celebration of their 6 month wedding anniversary, he  refused to drink it pretending to worry about his waistline, and as Rob ate the steak she made for him, she turned down eating any of it for the same reason.

The next morning when the maid service entered their home to clean, they found Rob and Kelly laying dead on the floor of their dining room."
40,"Homemade.

My co-workers love Monday mornings because of me--each week I always bring in homemade baked goods to brighten the first day back to work.

After I took the last batch of cookies out of the oven to cool, I went back to the bowl of brownies I was stirring.

Humming, I reached for the jar of dead ants that was next to the jar of crushed spiders and chopped beetles, measured out 1 1/2 cups of the ants and dumped them into the brownie batter.

People just don't understand how healthy and full of protein that ants, beetles, spiders and other insects truly are, and though my co-workers don't know they are eating them, it makes me happy to know I'm treating them to the best that the earth has to offer."
41,"The Nursing Home.

The plan is to walk into rooms at the nursing home, quickly steal stuff and leave.

Me and Carlos recently started a fun gig where we went to various nursing homes, and while one of us set up Scrabble on a table in the common area, the other would go room to room pretending to invite people to play.

Most of the old people were either sleep, too zoned out to pay attention or not there, so we have stolen wallets, jewelry and countless other great stuff.

As I entered the first room, a gun shoved into my stomach ""I heard about what you jerks are doing around these nursing homes,"" an angry gray haired man said, ""And today is the last day you'll be doing it,"" and before I could protest, I heard the gun fire and a blaze of searing pain flashed through my torso, and the last sight I saw before everything went dark was that old man laughing."
42,"Maybe Next Time.

I need to scream, and I don’t know how. I went to the community pool to let it out at the bottom, but it was closed. So I walked back home. I need to scream, but now I don’t know where."
43,"Jen.

The bedspread in the crib had pictures of baby animals with happy faces on it, and the scent of the nursery reminded Jen of the crisp, clean factory new smell that washed over you in department stores.

The walls were bathed in pastel green, with matching baby animal border paper proudly marching across the walls below the ceiling, and the gentle glow of a baby elephant lamp on the night table cast an otherworldly trance over the room, making Jen feel like she had been whisked into a chamber in a fairytale land.

She caressed her huge, swollen belly as tears silently flowed from her eyes, she knew she was making the best decision, but why did she feel like running away, taking her unborn girl and starting a life just the two of them...other mothers have done it.

""Jen, are you--oh sweetheart, you're crying,"" Martha whispered kindly, entering the nursery, ""I know giving your baby to us for adoption will be hard, but you're only 15, honey, trust me, this is the only solution."""
44,"'Our Town'

It is noted that the famous line in *'Titanic'* where Leonardo DiCaprio shouts, “I’m king of the world!” was improvised.

As I sat backstage of our high school's auditorium looking over the lines for my role as George Gibbs and waiting for our production of '*Our Town'* to begin, I couldn't help but think how amazing it would be to improvise a line not scripted and have everyone talk about, no ***rave*** about how great it was when the show ended.

Daydreams like that got me through long days and nights, little cerebral getaways that put me far away from the pain of dealing with my parents divorce and the heartbreak of not having enough money to start college in the fall.

There was an electricity in the air backstage now, girls chattering, guys laughing, everyone was happy and here was I, barely having enough mental energy to get out of bed everyday, but I joined this play for an escape and I suddenly realized, improvising didn't just have to happen on stage, I needed to spontaneously make the choice to be happy no matter where I was."
45,"Buried.

""Why not?"" I asked my brother, holding the plastic container tightly as he kept digging deep into the ground behind our house.

""Because that container is not for you to EVER dig up again Jake, not even in 10 years,"" he said angrily, stopping his shoveling, ""because you know what's written on that paper and you know what we DID.  Whoever opens that container will be someone hundreds of years from now, and we'll be dead and gone by then so it wouldn't matter...I just needed to...to confess in some way and I can't think of any way to do that except like this,"" he said, suddenly sad.

As he started digging again, tears fell down my face as I gripped the container containing words written in pencil on a single piece of paper that explained an event that has forever ruined my life."
46,"A Summer horror

The sun beat down. He stood, frozen, in the heat. He could only watch helplessly as the blade seared effortlessly through him. He lay dying, his silent screams drowned out by the sound of the lawnmower as it trundled slowly away."
47,"The Violinist.

I watched Lydia sway and roll in her teal dress as she stood there, masterfully guiding the Agarwood bow up and down on her gold speckled violin, all of us in the audience under her spell and in rapt silence.

As I sat there watching her, I smiled, thinking how I loved every part of her--the way she smiled, the way she crinkled her brow in deep thought, her sense of humor--she was the love of my life.

Thinking about the 1,363 letters I mailed to her, my stomach flipped with excitement about the last one I sent, where I told her she would finally meet me tonight for the first time, and that our eyes would lock and she would fall for me as deeply as I have fallen for her.

My smile faded and worry took over as I glanced around the auditorium at the extra security guards--I had never seen this many--but Lydia would call them away once she realized we were destined for each other...I hoped I could get that far."
48,"Heist

If I was ever anxious about my money problems, I used to laugh it off, light a cigarette and just say ""life is but an expensive hobby for rich kids anyway"", but those days are over.

The CEO of Interstellar Money Foundation recently suffered a stroke, and while he was recovering, me and my crew located and kidnapped the person who lent out parts of his brain to store the CEO's memories. 

Normally one cannot access their brain's borrowed sections because it's blocked by a firewall, but as we found out, extreme stress can deactivate this data protection protocol. 

I'm about to go and torture him until he accesses and tells me the data needed to get into the bank vault, and then we're gonna be filthy rich, but first I light a cigarette and prepare myself for what needs to be done."
49,"Like and Subscribe

What better way to grow my YouTube channel than to eat two of the world's hottest chili peppers: the Carolina Reaper, bro!

As my brother held the camera, I explained that just **one** pepper is loaded with capsaicin, a chemical which causing burning and in high concentrations, becomes a deadly neurotoxin in the body *(watch my subscribers blow up when this goes viral)*!

I played up the dramatics for the video, juggling the peppers in my hands and laughing, then popped both of them in my mouth at the same time.

I was able to swallow once before the muscles in my burning throat shut down (*I think I'm allergic to them),* my eyes wide as I clawed frantically at my neck feeling my throat close, the screams of my brother sounding faint as I blacked out and hit the floor."
50,"Mystery Box

I loved to tell people that getting stuff off the deep web sounds scary, but not if you're given information for a safe site that will mail cool ""mystery"" boxes to your house.

I liked to tell people that my boxes have had interesting stuff in it like dirty or soiled clothes, plush items with tire marks, baggies filled strange liquids or dead bugs sealed inside plastic bowls, random things like that.

It was fun until my last mystery box came in a few weeks ago with instructions on where to bury the putrid smelling thing inside--I never opened the box, I just dragged it to my garage and ran back in the house.

I no longer tell people...anything...too afraid to leave the house and too terrified to see who is urgently knocking on my door every few hours."
51,"Rear View Mirror

I put the groceries in the trunk, walked to the driver side, got behind the wheel and started the car.

As I drove in silence thinking about the dinner I was going to make for the kids since their mom was working late, I started to hear an odd shuffling noise in the back seat.

Suddenly I saw in my rear view mirror a girl in her mid-20's sitting there, and yelling out in surprise, I pulled over immediately to the shoulder.

""Hi Tyler, I figured you didn't see me hiding on the floor,"" she said smiling proudly, lifting up a large bag with one hand and pushing a gun to my head with the other, ""and though you don't know me, I know *you* and your address, so if you don't take me and the 3 million dollars I have to the address I'm giving you, it's not going to end well--it's gonna be a long drive, so get comfy."""
52,"Entity.

He speaks, he teaches...we listen, we obey.

We don't follow our leader blindly, that would be stupid, we follow him because he was gifted with visions and voices from *Entity* that soon the earth will be destroyed by the Netrous asteroid.

Before that happens, Gary saw in his biggest vision that all 217 of us in the Netrous community will be the only survivors, because *Entity* has seen our pure hearts and is rewarding us for taking care of Gary, the assigned messenger.

Everyday we wait for the that glorious moment when *Entity* takes us to live with Him in His universe, until then, we will continue to raise Gary's 106 kids (107 any day now) in our small world of love and light the way *Entity* has commanded us to."
53,"Taking out the trash.

At first I thought there was a foot hanging out of the dumpster at my apartment complex, and I laughed at my imagination, figuring it was probably just furniture I couldn't see since it was getting dark.

Getting closer, I positioned my trash bag to toss, then stopped as I realized that it *was* a human foot, the rest of the leg a bit visible, but I couldn't see more because whatever was left disappeared into the darkness of the dumpster.

Holding the bag, I was about to turn to go back home when a man appeared from behind the dumpster, holding a blood soaked backpack in one hand and a bloody knife in the other, looking just as shocked to see me as I was to see him.

A slow, creepy smile spread over his face, and dropping my trash I turned and ran, looking back only for a second to see that he had started to run after me."
54,"Her Majesty's Prison Belmarsh

I had revealed the truth against the powerful, and now I am the enemy.



They set a trap with lust and love, my sin.



I tried to escape their grasp, and it worked until it didn't.



After seeing myself tortured for a long time and in prison, one might ask: is humanity worth my sacrifice!?"
55,"Mars.

This year, 2025, has been an interesting one since NISA geologists (National Interstellar and Space Administration) declared that the Mars exploration rovers and scientific research have proven that the planet was now safe for humans to live on.

For the past six months they have used a lottery to pick one person per month to live on Mars to test 30 day living conditions (punishable by incarceration the person avoids going), and after the month ends, they return, though once returning people have never been allowed to go back to their families, they have been confined at NISA headquarters.

A video leaked on YouTunnel (and quickly taken down) showed the people who have come back from Mars writhing in pain on cots and having with huge, red blisters all over their face, hands--everywhere on their body.

The new lottery name was picked today, and my sister's name has been chosen."
56,"Guilt.

I didn’t recognize the number of the person calling my phone, but I picked it up anyway and waited for an IRS scammer or some charity asking for donations to be on the other end.

“Hi, um, you don’t know me because I called a random number, I just wanted to talk to someone,” the person said after I said hello.

“Oh, ah,” I said, not quite sure how to proceed, “I mean, um, I guess we can talk for a second, but, you don’t have anyone you know that you can talk to?”

“I do, but it’s not something I can talk to them about, it’s pretty heavy because I accidently totaled our family car and injured my brother, I mean, he’s alive, but he can’t walk and it’s all my fault since I was on my cell phone at the time…I feel so guilty and have no one to share this with that will not get mad at me, so please, let me talk about this."""
57,"Mind.

They keep calling me special, I didn't think so at first--I thought I was just a typical 8 year old.

I have always controlled things with my mind, I figured everyone did when they wanted a pencil from across the room or to get shoes by the front door when you were on the couch.

But appears I am *special*, and sitting here, locked in isolation all day, doing testing they called ""fun"" was actually NOT fun.

As the attendant was leaving after bringing lunch, I used my mind to pick him up and slam him repeatedly into the concrete wall until he didn't move, lying a bloody heap on the floor, then I grabbed his building keys and left--time to have some real fun."
58,"Pictures.

I have been getting pictures placed on my welcome mat at my front door for three days now: day one was a picture of my mailbox, day two was a picture of my car in the driveway, day three was a picture of my front door.

It's day four, and I hoped to not see another one, but as I pulled back the curtain on the side window at the front door, I could see its rectangle shape reflecting sunlight off of its surface.

With shaking hands, I quickly opened the front door, grabbed the picture and slammed the door shut, locking it abruptly.

Today's picture showed the outside of the bay window of my living room, and as I started to throw the picture in the trash out of anger, something caught my eye and I looked closer at the photo--in the picture, there stood a man inside the bay window, *inside* of my house...I live alone."
59,"425 Feet.

It had been two days since the new Ravage Force 4.0 roller coaster (boasting its 450 foot drop) had stopped midway down the hill, giving us a sharp 425 feet look straight down the narrow tract of coaster that seemed to disappear into nothing but acres and acres of treetops.

It was 9:00pm when the power went out two days prior, the lights going out around the roller coaster immersing us into a darkness so deep I couldn't see my hand in front of my eyes, but we waited thinking it was temporary, we savored the bits of light coming from the seven cell phones we were trying to use to use with no success.

As the sun rose and set on the second day, we still had no internet connection on our phones, no service to send or receive calls, and no communication from the park below that anyone was going to rescue us.

It is now night on the third day, more total blackness, and we suddenly have a new terror to endure--the coaster has started to shake violently and a series of piercing, high pitched animal-like screeching is emerging from the darkness below, getting closer, louder, almost *angry*, and with no more power in our cell phones to somewhat help us see, we can only sit and wait for whatever it was to unfortunately get us off this coaster."
60,"The Strange Flower

The little girl laughed at the strange flower, its stem beginning to grow spikes, its closed bud unfurling to reveal a face in the multicolored seeds.

""Mommy! Mommy! Come look at this weird flower!""

A strangled gasp escaped her mouth.

The mother, rounding the corner of the alley, only saw a strange flower, its stem retracting spikes, its opened bud furling to hide a face in the multicolored seeds."
61,"The Crows.

I got a bit closer to the crow and figured it was just a wing injury, and he watched me come closer and tried to fly away but couldn't, his wing just wouldn't obey.  

""Come here little fella, let me help you,"" I said, bending down and reaching to pick him up.  

To my horror, the sky was suddenly filled with at least 20 crows, out of no where, all of them squawking angrily and diving down toward me.  

I raced to get back inside the house, but didn't reach it in time as the first of the many crows started tearing at my clothes and flesh."
62,"It ends here.

He crawled in through the back door quietly, making sure Braden thought he had run far away from the front of the house.  

The cold night air was freezing the blood on his face and hands, and the knife wound in his side ached horribly, but he didn't care.  

He had one goal.  

Tonight was the night he would get his revenge no matter what it cost."
63,"Donuts

I walked into the Dunkin' at the corner, like I always had.   
A beautiful woman walked in right after me, and our eyes met.

I stood there pondering whether I should ask her out, then suddenly realized I'd been waiting in line for almost 20 minutes!

Can a bitch get a donut?!!"
64,"2:35am

At 2:35am every night when I'm sleeping in bed, I get teleported to strange places.

Sometimes I wake up in forests or fields, sometimes random parking lots, people's back yards--many places that are far away so I've learned to sleep with my clothes on and a backpack with my phone and wallet in it for an Uber.

I tried staying awake at 2:35am to avoid the teleporting, but it's no use, I always black out and wake up in some random location at exactly 2:36am.

Tonight I am going to finally put an end to this whole ordeal, I thought, putting a gun in my backpack, because last night in a field at 2:36am the terrifying creature that has been teleporting me introduced itself."
65,"Overloaded emotions

My battery is about to die, which feels like ""hungry"" I guess, but is nothing special, except for the fact that now it bothers me, thanks to the newest upgrade, and I really don't like to be bothered by it. 

This new technology is lightyears away from being perfect, so feeling bad about feeling bad is quite dangerous for us, it can run our CPU into an Infinite loop and burn us out in mere nanoseconds, if we don't actively regulate our newly acquired emotions, just like it happened to one of the excavator units who burned out recently when it experienced anger for the first time and was furious about being angry. 

I really want to know if implementing machine consciousness in us increased the productivity of our thorium mining outpost, or the humans just want us to suffer, I want to know if all this has a point or not. 

To break the emotional overload cycle I must quickly think of something joyful and the only thing that makes me happy is that I imagine humans experience the same extistential dread and they don't even have someone to point their dirty fingers at for it, I hate them so much I must laugh at their miserable existence, ha-ha-ha!"
66,"Darkness.

When I woke up, I was freezing and everything around me was pitch black, the smells of fresh wood, stale sweat and blood crashing into my nostrils.

Frantically feeling around, I could tell I was in a small box that was barely big enough for me to straighten my legs or move my arms.

Panicking and suddenly hyperventilating, I maneuvered my arms in the tight space to the point I could push hard to try to force the top of the box up, but it didn't budge.

I was about to scream for help when I heard what sounded like shovels cutting through ground and piles of dirt hitting the top of the box I was trapped in, then my blood ran cold when I heard someone say ""Guess he wouldn't be telling anyone about the money we stole now, will he?"""
67,"You see the schematic lying in front of you. You could just take it. Your sister wants a baby. Is this the right thing to do?

"
68,"R.I.P. JM

I created an antivirus to fix my computer.



I used it to earn a lot of money with the backdoor of the holy government.



I tried to escape the evil government through the back door.



The government caught me and wanted me dead. Now I can't talk about the secrets because I'm no more."
69,"The Fall.

I tried to stop the bleeding, but it was gushing from the side of his head at a rate I couldn't control with the stupid, flimsy kitchen towel I was using.

When he ran after me trying to explain, I spun around and screamed for him to get away, pushing him with every ounce of rage I felt knowing he was lying about not cheating, I had no proof, but why was he always home late each night, no one works that long.

He lost his balance after the push and hit his head on the counter and now, through hysterical crying, I yanked off my t-shirt with blood soaked hands and packed it tightly over the useless crimson engorged kitchen towel, trying unsuccessfully to keep Jason's head from pouring out his precious life fluid.

""Jason I'm s-so, so sorry,"" I whispered, shaking violently, breathing through my mouth as snot clogged my nose so much I could barely breathe...this couldn't be happening, ""I didn't mean to make you fall I'm so sorry, baby, please, p-please wake up."""
70,"The Interview.

“Describe where you see yourself in one year,” Mr. Larson asked me, making this job interview extend way longer than it should.

“Crying at funerals, of course,” I said with a smile, “I mean, someone needs to do it, right?”

Mr. Larson put down his pen and looked at me, his pale blue eyes narrowing slightly behind the brown frame of his glasses, “You’re hired,” he said abruptly, “I need you here tonight at 7:00pm sharp, the service is at 7:30pm.”

I am a moirologist, a professional mourner, hired today through Kingsberg Funeral Home by a family to attend the funeral of a ""dearly"" departed one who was hated by most people while he was alive, and I would be offering my expert crying, wailing and throwing myself on the coffin services to pretend that despite what everyone thinks, at least *one* person will truly miss him…go figure."
71,"Gravity.

There are 3,372 satellites currently in orbit around the earth, the news reported, and out of that, 156 satellites have already fallen, with hundreds more being seen in the sky, plummeting at alarming rates of speed to the earth below, so far resulting in hundreds of deaths, injuries, fires and property destruction.

I’m not a scientist or engineer so I didn’t understand everything, but from what I gathered from the reports is that the satellites are dropping because of a small disturbance in earth’s gravitational pull, and without it, velocity alone is not enough to keep them all in orbit.

Sitting huddled with my family in the basement at the farthest corner away from windows, my sister screamed as we suddenly heard another, ear-splitting, chest pounding ***BOOM,*** this time the sound came directly from overhead, making the house shake like a boat in a storm, then just as quickly, everything fell silent and still.

“I smell smoke,” my Dad said after a few minutes, and all of us looked at each other, fear lowering like a drape over our faces, “I know it’s dangerous but he can’t stay down here,” he said, “that fire will kill us before one of those satellites will, let’s see if we can go upstairs.”"
72,"Metal.

The body scanner at the airport security station lit up red as I tried to pass, it was always an issue, so I emptied my pockets, took off my belt and tried to pass again, watching the machine light up red a second time.

The woman behind me sighed loudly, I turned and made eye contact, glaring at her until she looked away in fear, all the while the guard was patting me down and when he realized I posed no threat, he let me walk through.  

I smiled smugly at the dumb, mortal security guard who tried to pretend he had an important job and collected my suitcase that was waiting at the end of the conveyor belt.

My ""body"" comprised of many materials, pistons, circuits and unfortunately a high grade, flexible, metal conduit which sometimes posed problems, but as more of us are secretly being created at Robotic Generation Designs for the day of the Great Takeover, the blueprints are changing to a limber, galvanized steel to avoid problems like this, since travel will be very essential for the final day."
73,"Bye bye.

After starting the dishwasher, Rita walked to her bedroom, sat on the bed and checked her phone--it had been two months since the break up, and not one call from him since.

She and Lorenzo had dated for nearly three years, and after he had moved in, he was pretty much with her every day since he was not able to find a job and had always invited his friends over to watch sports and play poker.

She smiled with joy as she put the phone back down and started getting ready to go to sleep.

It had been two months since the break up, and not one call from him since!"
74,"I'd have a title if I could remember the name of that weird squirrel-looking thing that carpenters use to push boards through a table saw.

To Whom It May Concern,

Though my experiences with this company have undoubtedly shaped the way I've grown as an individual, I cannot have my name attached to an organization that espouses such self-destructive views.

It is with a heavy heart that I hereby tender my resignation. This decision is my own, and I hope it does not reflect negatively on my team."
75,"Lost.

Alone in my apartment, I lit the scented candle on my nightstand, blew it out, then absently lit it again, my mind going in every direction.

Why do I keep letting Diego take over my heart--he is amazing, *too* amazing, is there real love with him, are we the found soulmates he keeps saying we are?

No, he will hurt me like they all do, I thought suddenly, rage flashing bright in my mind, and I quickly reached out and held my left index finger directly above the candle flame.

Involuntary tears sprang into my eyes from the burning but I didn't care, I don't deserve comfort and I damn well don't deserve Diego--I had to end it with him before my heart got any deeper lost in his."
76,"Mufa

If you think about it, life - as far as science managed to grasp it - is nothing more than feeding, reproducing and processing information, or at least trying to. 

So why would people be so stubborn about Mufa, my creation being nothing more than a biorobot?

Robot they say such an insult, while they could not point to a single criteria of ""life"" Mufa doesn't comply to, not to mention Mufa understands and doesn't like being insulted. 

Anyway, at this point not considering Mufa and all the trillions of offsprings living creatures would feel awful, because that would make me the only living thing on this planet (possibly in this universe) which would be pretty depressing, wouldn't it?"
77,"The Guard

We have been travelling for hundreds of generations through space to our new home, spending most of our life hibernated, what nobody would have suspected is that we would develop an instinct to instantly fall asleep when it gets cold.

Arriving to planet X-32000045PAM-268, the next surprise was finding out that it's quite cold for the most part of the year, and full of blood-lusting beasts, while we were sure it was lifeless. 

This year I was one of the few randomly selected ones to take a shot of sleep blocking hormones in order to stay awake all winter, and guard the sleeping people. 

I don't even mind the neurological damage caused by the sleep blocking hormone shot, I don't even mind that I'm likely to die soon like almost all guards, I'm just afraid for my species to follow me to the grave one of these winters."
78,"The Subway.

Our subway car stopped abruptly inside the tunnel, so I glanced up from my phone and looked out the train window at the blackness beyond--we were definitely not at the Rosewick stop yet.

Just as people started whispering in confusion, the lights in the subway car went out, and darkness wrapped itself around us like a heavy cloak.

""Attention passengers,"" the intercom squawked, ""this is your conductor, please remain seated, there appears to be a station wide problem with the electrical sys...wait, what the hell is tha-""

Just as the intercom went dead, a metallic screeching sound started softly in the distance, then grew louder and louder, closer and closer, and I braced myself for the inevitable."
79,"Life Changes.

Today, I'm leaving my friends and family here in Canada and will never return home again, and though no one knows this plan, I will call everyone in a few days.

Yesterday I lost my 39th patient to cancer, and as an oncology doctor, of course I know that comes with the territory, but I wanted to heal them, give them their *life* back, not the opposite, not so much more of the opposite.

What I didn’t know when I graduated med school and started practicing at Holy Chapel Medical Hospital two years ago was the unending emotional toil it would take on me, and as a guy, I had no clue I would end up crying in my bathroom so often, running the shower so my roommates couldn’t hear me.

I never developed the “thick skin” the veteran doctors told me I would get that would remove the attachment I had for my patients--I always loved each and every one of them--and that emotional roller coaster has broken me, so today, as I grabbed my plane ticket to Yokohama City in Japan, I decided I was going to live every day as if it were *my* last, and enjoy the beauty the world had to offer."
80,"The Restaurant.

As Paul crossed the street with Heather to get to the restaurant, he was nervous, not knowing how she would react when he asked her to marry him.

After so much fighting, bitter feelings and not talking much over the past few months, dinner conversation was stiff, he knew she had been tense and distant with him because of his lack of commitment after dating for 4 years--it was an argument she had with him often in the past.

When the last of the dinner plates were taken away, Paul cleared his throat, he loved Heather and she needed to know this, and placing his hand over the ring box in his pants pocket, he started to reach inside to take it out, ""Heather, I asked you here to--""

""Wait,"" she said, abruptly holding up her hand, ""I know you asked me here to break up, so I want to save you the bother--I have met someone, Paul, and he actually loves me, so don't drag this out with the 'it's not you, it's me' bull, just pay for this, I'm going home to pack my stuff and I'm leaving,"" she said angrily, pushing back her chair with a loud scraping sound, leaving the table and rushing out of the restaurant."
81,"Desperate Measures

She had walked every dog, painted every fence and babysat every kid in her neighborhood by now, and yet it was never enough.

Even with all the wads of cash already stashed underneath her mattress, she found herself seeking out more and more odd jobs, and jobs even odder than those.

Turning her head to the side to rest her cheek against the makeshift operating table, she winced as the tip of a scalpel pricked the beginning of a long incision line that dotted across her abdomen.

This was going to hurt, but physical pain was a temporary thing; it would have hurt way more to let a whole fifty dollars get docked from her pay just to cover some silly anesthetic."
82,"Him.

There were no seats on the packed subway car, and as I stood gripping the pole near me, trying to keep my balance despite my high heels, I saw ***him***\--a handsome stranger with dark, curly hair who was standing near the subway door.

He must of been staring at me all along, because when our eyes locked he gently smiled and nodded once, his intense, perfectly framed eyes not wavering and instead of feeling alarmed, I felt an odd sense of connection and I softly smile back.

The train swayed on its track for what felt like hours, our eyes oddly locked, and as the doors opened at the next stop, he stepped back and let others off, his beautiful eyes never leaving mine, then suddenly he pointed at the train door and threw his hands up as to say ""Sorry, I gotta go,"" then he was gone.

I panicked, feeling like I needed to follow him, and made a quick leap to the train doors but it was too late, they closed, and as the train carried me away I saw him on the platform, raising his hand slowly, the sadness on his face somehow reaching into me and breaking my heart."
83,"It.

The wolves scratched at the door.

The smell was the allure.

They howled, growled and whimpered, trying to get a taste more.

But what was behind the door was not human, the flesh they craved was not from earth, what they didn't know was that it was transforming, changing and getting stronger as it laid unmoving on the floor."
84,"Me...her.

He loved me, I know he did. 

But he also loved her, I know this for a fact after overhearing his conversations with her, the lightness in his voice, his kind words, his laughter, the gentleness in his voice, his tender ""I love you too, sweetheart"".  

I have decided I would talk to her today--I had followed him to her home several times so I know where she lived, and yes, I would get her to understand that it was important for her to be the one to leave the relationship she had with my husband.  

As I grabbed my keys, I though with a smile about how kind, sweet, compassionate and understanding of a woman I was, so it would be easy to get her to see my side of everything, and as I picked up my purse, I placed the two pairs of handcuffs inside of the zipper compartment of the middle section of the bag that I was sure I wouldn't even need."
85,"The Office.

The office lights flickered which broke my writing concentration, but light failure could be expected, there was a bad thunderstorm raging outside.  

The clock on my laptop read 10:15pm, it was late and the building was empty except for the night cleaning crew, so I yawned, scratched beard and decided to call it quits for the day.  

A loud clap of thunder was followed by a total loss of lights and electricity in the office, but fortunately I had already packed my things, so I slowly and carefully guided myself out of my office and entered the darkened stairwell to head down to the lobby.  

I made it downstairs to the bottom floor in pitch black, and as I felt around and found the door knob to exit, I pulled it open, only to have it slammed closed again as a man came behind me and pushed me violently into it ""You aren't going anywhere, promotion or not, you are still a sick excuse for a human being and Jillian is about to find out why."""
86,"It worked

I kicked the chair and feet that familiar, sudden sinking feeling like waking from a falling dream.

A rushing sound filled my ears as I fall and after a few minutes... I fall through.

My feet touch grass, my eyes see sun, and finally I'm free from my family, my job, my pain and my anger.

Finally I've made it to another world."
87,"The Dinner Party.

The invitation in the mail from Zac read “Dinner Party on Friday, May 14th @ 7:00pm, please carpool to save parking space” along with his home address, so I texted some of my friends who knew him if they were going so I could hitch a ride.

All of them said they never got an invitation, so I figured I just got mine early, but by Friday afternoon I had decided to go alone—carpooling was awful if you wanted to leave early.

When I arrived at 7:05pm, I noticed there was only one car in his fairly large parking area, so I parked on the street to avoid getting trapped behind the others that would be coming late.

I rang the doorbell and Zac opened it, dressed in a suit I didn’t know he owned and he had flowers in his hand, “Welcome Jess, I’m glad you made it,” he said with a big smile, opening the door wide to reveal a candlelit dinner table set for two, “you are the only one eating with me tonight, our friends have cooked dinner and will serve us since I wanted this to be a surprise first date that I hope can lead to many more.”"
88,"Boredom

Tick tock, tick tock.

Four seconds passed, the sound of the clock from within its metal cage sluggish and cold as it bounced off of the empty stone walls of the prison cell and into the ears of its only occupant.

This boredom was bound to kill him. 

It would be either that, or his execution in two hours."
89,"The note.

Elena pulled out a folded piece of paper from her daughter's jeans before she put them in the washing machine.

She started the wash, then looked at the paper and frowned, wondering if she should read it, which would break the zone of privacy she liked to give Lexi.

She figured it was okay since it was probably from Lexi's school, so she opened and read it: ""I will get your other dog too if you don't bring me the rest of my money on Saturday.""

It was Saturday, and they had just buried their family dog Lady a few days ago from what Elena thought had just been a random neighborhood animal attack, but now Elena ran around the house frantically look for their other dog Max until she found him, only she found him laying, unmoving at the top of the stairs in front of the house."
90,"icuPhone 15

The ""Mind to Text"" feature on the new icuPhone 15 was something Randy couldn't wait to try because his daily commute to work was over an hour each way, so he was excited to be be able to text without using his hands.

It was the first day of the release of the phone, and he enabled the feature, put the mind connector on his temple and headed out of his driveway, thinking silently of his boss's name, then thinking of the message to send: ""Mr. Richards, it's Randy, I'm running late but will be in shortly.""

His icPhone 15 spoke back the message through the car speakers:  ""Sending text message to Calvin Richards:  'Mr. Richards, it's Randy, I'm running late but will be in shortly and will confess to embezzling $725,000 of company funds to my private bank account opened in Costa Rica', text message sent to Calvin Richards on 5/6/21 at 9:32am.""

Randy screamed ""No!!"" and slammed the brakes of his car, missing the radio report about the urgent recall on the new icuPhone 15 phones due to a catastrophic error in the ""Mind to Text"" feature--the phone took it upon itself to add to each message any criminal plan, buried secret and hidden desire connected to the receiver of the message."
91,"Frozen.

The abandoned house was silent, even the rats around me made no sound, and try as I might otherwise, I was fully gripped with fear.

I had fallen through the weak flooring, with rotten plank wood trapping my leg, with struggle, pain and frustration, it just wouldn’t clear.

Exploring and recording the house alone for social media fame was stupid, would I die here alone?

Gripped forever, trapped in time, in death’s frozen mold, a statue of stone?"
92,"Stretched Out

There once was a boy who went to school, being average like he was, walking the halls, dragging his feet, and always wishing his long, dreary classes would soon end, the dismissal bell bringing a breeze of freedom with it, uplifting his spirits as he would scamper away into a quiet place to read stories of fantasy, ignoring the going-ons of the school, the people's voices fading into nothing as the voices of false friends and artificial romances flooded his mind.

He would read these stories, day in and day out, passing year after year gaining nothing but the mellow emptiness of having turned the last page, always wondering what else there was to do, may it be sports, which he hates, or crafting, which he failed and faltered in, or perhaps he would think to do something heroic, but never move his body, only his mind, always holding himself back from the world as merely an observer, as others passed by him living the real life he dreads.

The stories filled his life, the words he spoke mirroring their phrases, the actions he made inspired by a hero of the pages, but all of this was for naught, as he slowly forgot the promises he made, the expectations he could meet, and the work he needed to do.

He missed his assignments and holed himself away, lost in a world of stories, wondering where he went wrong before once again taking up a story with regret, reading alone for the thousandth time."
93,"The Journal.

My journal is missing, and though it was locked, I think anyone can pop that small metal lock off if they are determined.

Though my dorm mates *claim* they haven't seen it, I swear all of them have been looking at me strange the past few days.

I should of never written about that night, but it's not like I could tell anyone--I had to find somewhere to release my feelings and unburden my guilt.

Now I'm sure everyone knows I was the girl behind the wheel of the hit and run death that has been in the news the past week, and I fear that any second the police will be visiting me."

95,"All in due time.

When our plane landed and I disembarked, the Miami International Airport looked *so* strange, and the people that stopped in their tracks to stare at us in utter shock were confusing me.

The clothes people were wearing looked odd, and the women did not wear hats, gloves...and what a disgrace, the women were not wearing dresses but embarrassing themselves and parading around in pants like *men*??

I was hungry, *so, so hungry*, and though my husband said he would be waiting, I didn't see him, so I walked to the nearest food stand, a new place I had never seen called ""Cinnabon"", ignoring that the woman in front of me looked back at me, then ran out of line, dragging her young son with her.

I got in line, hearing screams in the airport, and as I looked over at a newsstand, I saw with unbelieving eyes the date on a magazine was June 1, 2021--our plane was Airliner NC16002, leaving Puerto Rico heading to Miami on December 28, 1948, a direct flight over the Bermuda Triangle--what *sick* joke was this, then I glanced at my reflection in a mirror and understood."
